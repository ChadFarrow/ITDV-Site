# Task ID: 52
# Title: Create Doerfels-Only Version for TJ
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a specialized version of the site that only shows content from Doerfels, filtering out all other publishers and feeds for TJ's use
# Details:
Develop a Doerfels-only version of the application that filters content to show only Doerfels-related music and shows. This includes creating a separate deployment or configuration option, implementing content filtering logic, updating the UI to reflect the Doerfels-only branding, and ensuring all functionality works with the filtered content set.

# Test Strategy:
Test the Doerfels-only version to ensure it only displays Doerfels content, maintains all core functionality (playback, navigation, search), and provides a clean user experience focused on Doerfels music and shows.
