# Title: Fix Service Worker API Interception and Decoding Errors
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix Service Worker issues causing API decoding failures
# Details:
The site is experiencing Service Worker issues where it's intercepting API requests to /api/albums and causing 'Decoding failed' errors. Need to fix the Service Worker configuration to properly handle API requests and prevent decoding failures. The Service Worker is interfering with the API responses and causing the site to fail loading album data. UPDATE: Service Worker is now disabled but 'Decoding failed' errors persist. This suggests the issue is not with Service Worker but with the API response itself or how it's being processed. CRITICAL: Infinite recursion errors persist even after removing debugging code. The page loads visually but JavaScript crashes with 'too much recursion' errors in NextJS. Need to identify the root cause in React component logic, likely in useEffect dependencies, state updates, or component re-rendering cycles.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints directly, verify Service Worker doesn't interfere with API requests, ensure album data loads properly.
