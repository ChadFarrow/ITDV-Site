# Task ID: 48
# Title: Fix Auto-Play Not Working
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix auto-play functionality so that audio automatically starts playing when users click on album tracks or when the player is initialized
# Details:
The audio player should automatically start playing when users click on album tracks or when the player is initialized. This includes resolving any browser autoplay restrictions, ensuring proper audio context initialization, and handling mobile device autoplay limitations. Need to investigate current audio context setup, browser autoplay policies, and mobile device compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Test auto-play functionality across different browsers and devices. Verify that clicking on tracks starts playback immediately, and that the audio context initializes properly without user interaction requirements.
