# Title: Fix RSS Feed Parsing Duplication and Performance Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve duplicate RSS feed parsing and optimize batch processing performance
# Details:
The console logs show RSS feeds being parsed multiple times unnecessarily. This includes: 1) Same feeds parsed repeatedly (e.g., "Safe Some Place", "Goodbye Uncle Walt" appearing multiple times), 2) Redundant batch processing operations, 3) Performance impact from duplicate parsing. Need to implement proper deduplication, caching, and optimize the batch processing logic to prevent redundant operations and improve loading performance.
