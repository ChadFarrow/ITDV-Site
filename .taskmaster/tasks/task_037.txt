# Title: Fix Progress Bar Time Format Display
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix the progress bar time display to show proper HH:MM:SS format instead of just minutes. The time display should be consistent with standard audio player formatting.
# Details:
The progress bar time display is showing time in minutes format instead of the expected HH:MM:SS format. Need to fix the time formatting logic in the audio player component to display time properly.

# Test Strategy:
Test the progress bar time display to ensure it shows HH:MM:SS format correctly for tracks of different lengths, including tracks longer than 1 hour.
