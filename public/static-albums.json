It took on it's own sound, not exactly metal, but close enough. However, after over 25 hours of creating and producing it, my Macbook with all the projects files, it's hard drive died. I was unable to recover the project or anything else on it and after trying to remove the HD, smashed it with a hammer with wrath. I had saved a few semi-mixed versions, and decided to move forward and release it. \nFun fact: 5 string banjos are surprisingly heavy, coming in at around 12 pounds. It's because other than the neck, it has a lot of metal pecies that help make up its tone.",

      "summary": "METAL IN THE BANJO by TJ Doerfel(Sir TJ The Wrathful)\nI made this song for Sir Libre after somehow it came up in discussion that I should make a metal banjo song. It took on it's own sound, not exactly metal, but close enough. However, after over 25 hours of creating and producing it, my Macbook with all the projects files, it's hard drive died. I was unable to recover the project or anything else on it and after trying to remove the HD, smashed it with a hammer with wrath. I had saved a few semi-mixed versions, and decided to move forward and release it. \nFun fact: 5 string banjos are surprisingly heavy, coming in at around 12 pounds. It's because other than the neck, it has a lot of metal pecies that help make up its tone.",

I would say this is relaxing, acoustic, instrumental music. I made this as a solo project while performing with The Doerfels, the band I started with four of my younger brothers and our only sister. \nAnyways, If you dare to listen, Beware of Banjo!\n\nIf you receive any value from this music, which I loved making, please let me know with any kind of value!
