I would say this is relaxing, acoustic, instrumental music. I made this as a solo project while performing with The Doerfels, the band I started with four of my younger brothers and our only sister. \nAnyways, If you dare to listen, Beware of Banjo!\n\nIf you receive any value from this music, which I loved making, please let me know with any kind of value!

Can you pick out the veteran from the 13 year old as they pick through these old traditional tunes? Doug is now part of the family as Ben married Dougs daughter, Emma in 2020.
